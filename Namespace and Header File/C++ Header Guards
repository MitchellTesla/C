Multiple source files might include the same header file.

To ensure that our header is included only once in the compilation process, we use the mechanism called header guards.

It ensures that our header content is included only once in the compilation process.

We surround the code in our header file with the following macros:

Copy
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

// header file source code
// goes here

#endif
This approach ensures the code inside a header file is included only once during the compilation phase.
