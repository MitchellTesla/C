C++ supports a wide range of string-manipulation functions.

The most common are.

Copy
strcpy()
strcat()
strlen()
strcmp()
The string functions all use the same header, <cstring>.

strcpy
A call to strcpy() takes this general form:

Copy
strcpy(to, from);
The strcpy() function copies the contents of the string from into to.

Remember, the array that forms to must be large enough to hold the string contained in from.

If it isn't, the to array will be overrun, which will probably crash your program.

The following program will copy "hello" into string str:

Copy
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char str[80];

  strcpy(str, "hello");
  cout << str;

  return 0;
}
