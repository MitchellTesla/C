Question 1
Write a program that defines two strings.

Join them together and assign the result to a third-string.

Print out the value of the resulting string.



#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s1 = "Hello";
    std::string s2 = " World!";
    std::string s3 = s1 + s2;
    std::cout << "The resulting string is: " << s3;
}
Question 2
Write a program that accepts the first and the last name from the standard input using the std::getline() function.

Store the input in a single string called fullname.

Print out the string.




#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string fullname;
    std::cout << "Please enter the first and the last name: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, fullname);
    std::cout << "Your name is: " << fullname;
}

Question 3
Write a program that creates two substrings from the main string.

The main string is made up of first and last names and is equal to "John Doe."

The first substring is the first name.

The second substring is the last name.

Print the main string and two substrings afterward.




#include <iostream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::string fullname = "John Doe";
    std::string firstname = fullname.substr(0, 4);
    std::string lastname = fullname.substr(5, 3);
    std::cout << "The full name is: " << fullname << '\n';
    std::cout << "The first name is: " << firstname << '\n';
    std::cout << "The last name is: " << lastname << '\n';
}
Question 4
Write a program that defines the main string with a value of "Hello C++ World." and checks if a single character 'C' is found in the main string.




#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s = "Hello C++ World.";
    char c = 'C';
    auto characterfound = s.find(c);
    if (characterfound != std::string::npos)
    {
         std::cout << "Character found at position: " << characterfound <<
          '\n';
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Character was not found." << '\n';
    }
}
Question 5
Write a program that defines the main string with a value of "Hello C++ World." and checks if a substring "C++" is found in the main string.




#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string s = "Hello C++ World.";
    std::string mysubstring = "C++";
    auto mysubstringfound = s.find(mysubstring);

    if (mysubstringfound != std::string::npos)
    {
         std::cout << "Substring found at position: " << mysubstringfound <<
          '\n';
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Substring was not found." << '\n';
    }
}


Both the 'C' character and the "C++" substring start at the same position in our main string.

That is why both examples yield a value of 6.

Instead of typing the lengthy std::string::size_type type for our characterfound and mysubstringfound variables, we used the auto specifier to deduce the type for us automatically.
