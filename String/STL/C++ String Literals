C++ supports one other type of literal in addition to those of the predefined data types: the string.

A string is a set of characters enclosed by double quotes.

For example, "this is a test" is a string.

Although C++ allows you to define a string literal, it does not have a built-in string data type.

The strings are supported in C++ as character arrays.

Standard C++ does provide a string type in its class library.

char vs string
A single character literal is enclosed by single quotes, as with 'a', is a char literal.

However, "a" is a string containing only one letter.
