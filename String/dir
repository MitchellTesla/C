In C++, a string is defined as a character array that is terminated by a null.

A null character is specified using '\0', and is zero.

Because of the null terminator, we need to declare a character array to be one character longer than the largest string that it will hold.

For example, if you want to declare an array str that could hold a 10-character string, you would write:

Copy
char str[11];
Specifying the size as 11 makes room for the null at the end of the string.

C++ allows you to define a string literal.

A string literal is a list of characters enclosed in double quotes.

Here are some examples:

Copy
"hello there"
"I like C++"
"#$%@@#$"
""
The last string shown is "". This is called a null string.

It contains only the null terminator, and no other characters.

Null strings are useful because they represent the empty string.

It is not necessary to manually add the null onto the end of string constants; the C++ compiler does this for you automatically.
