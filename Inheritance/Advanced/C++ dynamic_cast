The dynamic_cast function converts pointers of base class to pointers to derived class and vice versa up the inheritance chain.

Example:

Copy
#include <iostream>

class MyBaseClass {
public:
    virtual ~MyBaseClass() {}
};
class MyDerivedClass : public MyBaseClass {};

int main()
{
    MyBaseClass* base = new MyDerivedClass;
    MyDerivedClass* derived = new MyDerivedClass;

    // base to derived
    if (dynamic_cast<MyDerivedClass*>(base))
    {
        std::cout << "OK.\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Not convertible.\n";
    }

    // derived to base
    if (dynamic_cast<MyBaseClass*>(derived))
    {
        std::cout << "OK.\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Not convertible.\n";
    }

    delete base;
    delete derived;
}
Output:


If the conversion succeeds, the result is a pointer to a base or derived class, depending on our use-case.

If the conversion cannot be done, the result is a pointer of value nullptr.

To use this function, our class must be polymorphic, which means our base class should have at least one virtual function.

The following code tries to convert some unrelated class to one of our classes in the inheritance chain we would use:

Copy
#include <iostream>

class MyBaseClass {
public:
    virtual ~MyBaseClass() {}
};
class MyDerivedClass : public MyBaseClass {};
class MyUnrelatedClass {};

int main()
{
    MyBaseClass* base = new MyDerivedClass;
    MyDerivedClass* derived = new MyDerivedClass;
    MyUnrelatedClass* unrelated = new MyUnrelatedClass;

    // base to derived
    if (dynamic_cast<MyUnrelatedClass*>(base))
    {
        std::cout << "OK.\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Not convertible.\n";
    }
    // derived to base
    if (dynamic_cast<MyUnrelatedClass*>(derived))
    {
        std::cout << "OK.\n";
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "Not convertible.\n";
    }

    delete base;
    delete derived;
    delete unrelated;
}
Output:


This would fail as the dynamic_cast can only convert between related classes inside the inheritance chain.

The static_cast function is probably the only cast we will be using most of the time.
