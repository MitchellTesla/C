The three pillars of object-oriented programming are:

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Encapsulation is grouping the fields into different visibility zones, hiding implementation from the user, and exposing the interface, for example.

Inheritance is a mechanism where we can create classes by inheriting from a base class.

Inheritance creates a certain class hierarchy and relationship between them.

Polymorphism is an ability of an object to morph into different types during runtime, ensuring the proper function is invoked.

This is achieved through inheritance, virtual and overridden functions, and base and derived class pointers.
