By convention, if a pointer contains the null (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.

Thus, if all unused pointers are given the null value and you avoid the use of a null pointer, you can avoid the accidental misuse of an uninitialized pointer.

This is a good practice to follow.

Any type of pointer can be initialized to null when it is declared.

For example, the following initializes p to null:

Copy
float *p = 0; // p is now a null pointer
To check for a null pointer, use an if statement, like one of these:

Copy
if(p) // succeeds if p is not null

if(!p) // succeeds if p is null
If you follow the null pointer convention, you will avoid many problems when using pointers.
