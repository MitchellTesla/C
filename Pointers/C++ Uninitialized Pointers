The classic example of a pointer error is the uninitialized pointer.

Consider this example:

Copy
// This program is wrong.

int main(){
  int x, *p;

  x = 10;
  *p = x; // where does p point?

  return 0;
}
Here, p contains an unknown address because it has never been defined.

You will have no way of knowing where the value of x has been written.

Note: make sure that a pointer is pointing to something valid before using it!.
