You can use a pointer on the left side of an assignment statement to assign a value to the location pointed to by the pointer.

Assuming that p is an integer pointer, this assigns the value 101 to the location pointed to by p:

Copy
*p = 101;
The above statement is saying: "at the location pointed to by p, assign the value 101."

To increment or decrement the value at the location pointed to by a pointer, you can use a statement like this:

Copy
(*p)++;
The parentheses are necessary because the * operator has lower precedence than the ++ operator.

The following program demonstrates assignment using a pointer.

Copy
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int *p, num;

  p = &num;

  *p = 100;
  cout << num << ' ';
  (*p)++;
  cout << num << ' ';
  (*p)--;
  cout << num << '\n';

  return 0;
}
